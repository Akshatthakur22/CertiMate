# 🎓 CertiMate

Automated certificate generation — simple and practical.

CertiMate helps generate certificates in bulk without manual effort.  
Upload a certificate design, add a CSV, and generate personalized certificates in minutes.

## ✨ Why CertiMate

I built CertiMate after watching a college event organizer spend hours manually creating certificates for 200+ participants.

That kind of repetitive work felt unnecessary — it’s something software should handle.

CertiMate exists to remove that friction.
