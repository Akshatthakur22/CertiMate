## 🚀 What is CertiMate?

CertiMate automates the most time-consuming part of certificate creation.

Instead of manually editing names, adjusting text, and exporting files one by one, you simply:
- Upload a certificate design
- Upload a CSV with participant details
- Let CertiMate handle the rest

It uses **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to understand your design and automatically place names with proper alignment and formatting.

## 👨‍💻 About the Builder

Hey, I’m **Akshat** 👋  

I build simple tools that remove boring, repetitive work.  
CertiMate started after I watched someone spend an entire weekend manually creating certificates for hundreds of participants.

I believe if software can save time, it should — without friction, cost, or complexity.
